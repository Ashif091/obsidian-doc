The `git pull` command is used to fetch changes from a remote repository and integrate them into the current working branch. Essentially, it is a combination of two Git commands: `git fetch` and `git merge`.

Here is how `git pull` works:

1. **Fetch Changes from Remote:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin <branch_name>
   ```
   This command fetches the changes from the specified remote repository (usually named "origin") and the specified branch. It's equivalent to running:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin <branch_name>
   ```

   The `git fetch` command retrieves changes from the remote repository but doesn't automatically merge them into your local working branch.

2. **Merge Changes into the Current Branch:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin <branch_name>
   ```
   After fetching changes, the `git pull` command automatically merges the changes into your current working branch. If there are no conflicts, Git performs a fast-forward merge.

   If there are conflicts, Git will pause and ask you to resolve them manually before completing the merge.

The syntax for `git pull` is as follows:
```bash
git pull [<remote_name>] [<branch_name>]
```

- `<remote_name>` is the name of the remote repository (usually "origin").
- `<branch_name>` is the branch from which changes should be pulled. If not specified, Git will attempt to pull changes from the currently checked-out branch's upstream branch.

It's worth noting that while `git pull` is a convenient way to fetch and merge changes in a single command, some developers prefer to use `git fetch` followed by `git merge` to have more control over the process and inspect changes before merging.

If you want to fetch changes without merging immediately, you can use `git fetch` followed by manual merging or inspecting the changes before merging.
