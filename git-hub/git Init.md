The `git init` command is used to create a new Git repository. It sets up all the necessary Git metadata for the new repository in a `.git` subdirectory within the current working directory. This metadata includes subdirectories for objects, refs, and template files. A `HEAD` file is also created which points to the currently checked out commit [1](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-init#:~:text=The%20git%20init%20command%20creates,run%20in%20a%20new%20project.).

Here are some common usages of `git init`:

- `git init`: Transforms the current directory into a Git repository.
- `git init <directory>`: Creates an empty Git repository in the specified directory.
- `git init --bare <directory>`: Initializes an empty Git repository without a working directory. This is typically used for shared repositories [1](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-init#:~:text=The%20git%20init%20command%20creates,run%20in%20a%20new%20project.).
