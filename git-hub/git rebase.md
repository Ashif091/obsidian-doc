`git rebase` is a Git command used for modifying the commit history of a branch. It allows you to integrate changes from one branch into another by moving, combining, or omitting commits. Unlike `git merge`, which creates a new merge commit, `git rebase` rewrites the commit history by applying each commit from the source branch onto the target branch.

Here's a basic overview of how `git rebase` works:

1. **Switch to the Target Branch:**
   Before starting a rebase, ensure you are on the branch where you want to apply the changes. For example, if you want to rebase branch `feature` onto `main`, you would typically switch to `main`.

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Start the Rebase:**
   Use the `git rebase` command to start the rebase process. Specify the branch you want to rebase onto as an argument.

   ```bash
   git rebase <source_branch>
   ```

   For example, to rebase `feature` onto `main`:

   ```bash
   git rebase feature
   ```

3. **Resolve Conflicts (if any):**
   If there are conflicts during the rebase, Git will pause and ask you to resolve them manually. Use `git add` to mark conflicts as resolved.

   ```bash
   git add <conflicted_files>
   ```

   Continue the rebase with:

   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

4. **Abort the Rebase (if needed):**
   If you encounter issues or decide to cancel the rebase, you can use:

   ```bash
   git rebase --abort
   ```

5. **Finish the Rebase:**
   Once all conflicts are resolved and the rebase is complete, you may need to force-push the changes to the remote repository, especially if the branch has already been pushed.

   ```bash
   git push origin <branch_name> --force
   ```

`git rebase` can be a powerful tool, but it should be used with caution, especially when rewriting history on shared branches. It's generally recommended for feature branches or personal branches but not for branches that others are collaborating on. Be mindful that rewriting history can make it difficult for collaborators to sync their work.
