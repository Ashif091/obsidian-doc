In Git, the `git merge` command is used to combine changes from one branch into another. The branch into which changes are merged is typically called the "target" branch, and the branch from which changes are merged is called the "source" branch. Merging is a fundamental operation in Git that allows different lines of development to come together.

Here's how you can use the `git merge` command:

1. **Switch to the Target Branch:**
   Before merging, make sure you are on the branch where you want to merge changes. Use the `git checkout` or `git switch` command to switch to the target branch.

   ```bash
   git checkout <target_branch>
   # OR
   git switch <target_branch>
   ```

2. **Merge Changes from the Source Branch:**
   Use the `git merge` command to bring changes from the source branch into the target branch.

   ```bash
   git merge <source_branch>
   ```

   This command incorporates changes from the specified source branch into the current (target) branch. If there are no conflicts, Git will automatically perform a "fast-forward" merge. If there are conflicting changes, Git will pause and ask you to resolve the conflicts.

3. **Resolve Conflicts (if any):**
   If there are conflicts during the merge, Git will notify you, and you need to manually resolve the conflicts. Open the conflicted files, make the necessary changes, and then use the following commands to complete the merge:

   ```bash
   git add <conflicted_files>
   git merge --continue
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use `git mergetool` to open a visual merge tool to help resolve conflicts.

4. **Commit the Merge:**
   After resolving conflicts, commit the changes to complete the merge.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Merge changes from <source_branch>"
   ```

   This creates a new commit that represents the merged changes.

5. **Push the Merged Changes (if applicable):**
   If you want to share the merged changes with others, use the `git push` command:

   ```bash
   git push origin <target_branch>
   ```

Merging is a powerful and common operation in Git, allowing teams to collaborate on different features or bug fixes in parallel and then integrate those changes back into a main branch or release branch.
