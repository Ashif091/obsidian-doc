Combining reducers is a technique used in Redux to manage multiple slices of state by splitting them into separate reducer functions and then combining them into a single root reducer. This allows each reducer to manage a specific slice of the application state, making the overall state management more organized and scalable.

```js
// userReducer.js
const userReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    // Reducer logic for managing user state
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// todosReducer.js
const todosReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    // Reducer logic for managing todos state
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// rootReducer.js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import userReducer from './userReducer';
import todosReducer from './todosReducer';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  user: userReducer,
  todos: todosReducer
});

export default rootReducer;

```
