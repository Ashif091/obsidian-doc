- A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges
- A tree is a non-linear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures.
- In linear data structures, the time required to search is proportional to the size of the data set
- Trees however, owing to the nonlinear nature allow quicker and easier access to the data
- A tree will not contain any loops or cycles.
