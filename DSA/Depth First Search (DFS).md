- The DFS algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
- Visit the root node, visit all the nodes in the left subtree and visit all the nodes in the right subtree
- Depending on the order in which we do this, there can be three types of DFS traversals
	1. [[Preorder]]
	2. [[Inorder]]
	3. [[Postorder]]
