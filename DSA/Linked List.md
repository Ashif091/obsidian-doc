- A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes
﻿- Each node consists of a data value and a pointer that points to the next node
- The list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure
- Random access of elements is not feasible and accessing an element has linear time complexity
- The linked list data structure supports three main operations
	- [[Insertion]] - to add an element at the beginning, end or at a given index in the
	- [[list Deletion]] - to remove an item given its index or value
	- [[Search]] - to find an element given its value
