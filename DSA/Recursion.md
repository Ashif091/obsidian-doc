### What?
- Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem
- Recursion is when a function calls itself
### Why?
- A great technique to simplify your solution
- If you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller versions of the same problem, recursion is very useful

### A few points about recursion
-----------------
- Every recursive solution needs to have a base case a , condition to terminate the recursion.
- Recursion might simplify solving a problem but it does not always translate to a faster solution. A recursive solution may be far worse compared to an iterative solution.
- Recursion is a topic that is not the most straight forward to understand. Do not give up if you struggle with the concept.
