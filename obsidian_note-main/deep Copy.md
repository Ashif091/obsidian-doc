**Deep Copy:**<span style="color:#00b0f0"> Deep copying creates a new object or array that is a complete and independent copy of the original, including all nested objects and arrays.</span> This means that none of the nested structures are shared between the original and the copy. Changes made to the nested structures in the original will not affect the copied object or array, and vice versa.

Deep copying methods usually involve recursive functions that traverse through the entire structure and create new instances of nested objects and arrays.

```js
// Deep copy example
function deepCopy(obj) { 
// ... 
}  
const originalObject = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const deepCopyObject = deepCopy(originalObject);
```
