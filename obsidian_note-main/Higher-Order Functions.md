<span style="color:#00b0f0">Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as their results. It's like functions that work with other functions.</span>


```js 
function higherOrder(operation) {
  return operation(5, 3); // Here, 'operation' is a function
}

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const result = higherOrder(add); // Pass the 'add' function as an argument
console.log(result); // Output: 8
