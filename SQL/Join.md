To join the `name_list` table with the `employees` table, you'll typically use a SQL JOIN operation. Assuming there's a common field between the two tables that you can use to establish the relationship, such as the employee's name, you can perform a join based on that field.

Here's an example of how you can perform an inner join between the `name_list` and `employees` tables using the `name` column as the common field:

```SQL
SELECT employees.*, name_list.*
FROM employees
INNER JOIN name_list ON employees.employee_name = name_list.name;
```
