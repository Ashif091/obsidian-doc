A primary key in SQL is a unique identifier for each record in a table, ensuring that each row can be uniquely identified. It must contain unique values and cannot contain NULL values. A table can have only one primary key, which can consist of a single column or multiple columns (composite primary key). Primary keys are crucial for maintaining data integrity and enabling efficient data retrieval through indexing. They also play a vital role in establishing relationships between tables through foreign keys
