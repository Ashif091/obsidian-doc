- Ensuring proper search engine optimization (SEO) is crucial for increasing visibility and attracting users
- Next.js introduced the Metadata API which allows you to define metadata for each page
- Metadata ensures accurate and relevant information is displayed when your pages are shared or indexed
ï»¿

## Configuring Metadata
- Export a static metadata object
- Export a dynamic generateMetadata function
## Metadata rules
- Both layout.tsx and page.tsx files can export metadata. If defined in a layout, it applies to all pages in that layout, but if defined in a page, it applies only to that page
- Metadata is read in order, from the root level down to the final page level
- When there's metadata in multiple places for the same route, they get combined, but page metadata will replace layout metadata if they have the same properties
