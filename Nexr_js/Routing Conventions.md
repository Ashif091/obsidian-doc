>Next.js provides file-based routing, which means that the structure and names of the files within the `pages` directory determine the routes of your application.
- All routes must be placed inside the app folder
- Every file that corresponds to a route must be named page.js or page.tsx
- Every folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL
- The `pages` directory is the root of all the routes in your application. Each file represents a route, and the file name corresponds to the path of the route.
### Basic Concepts

1. **[[Basic Routes]]**
2. **[[Nested Routes]]**: Subdirectories within the `pages` directory create nested routes.
3. **[[Dynamic Routes]]**: You can create dynamic routes by using square brackets in file names. For example, `[id].js` can be used to create a dynamic segment.
