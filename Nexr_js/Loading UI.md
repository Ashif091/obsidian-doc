### loading.tsx
- This file allows us to create loading states that are displayed to users while a specific route segment's content is loading
- The loading state appears immediately upon navigation, giving users the assurance that the application is responsive and actively loading content
****
### loading.tsx Benefits
1. You can display the loading state as soon as a user navigates to a new route
The immediate feedback reassures users that their action has been
acknowledged, reduces perceived loading times, and makes the application feel more responsive.
2. Next.js allows the creation of shared layouts that remain interactive while new route segments are loading
Users can continue interacting with certain parts of the application, such as a navigation menu or sidebar, even if the main content is still being fetched
