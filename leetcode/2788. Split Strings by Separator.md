Given an array of strings `words` and a character `separator`, **split** each string in `words` by `separator`.

Return _an array of strings containing the new strings formed after the splits, **excluding empty strings**._

**Notes**

- `separator` is used to determine where the split should occur, but it is not included as part of the resulting strings.
- A split may result in more than two strings.
- The resulting strings must maintain the same order as they were initially given.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = ["one.two.three","four.five","six"], separator = "."
**Output:** ["one","two","three","four","five","six"]
**Explanation:** In this example we split as follows:

"one.two.three" splits into "one", "two", "three"
"four.five" splits into "four", "five"
"six" splits into "six" 

Hence, the resulting array is ["one","two","three","four","five","six"].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = ["$easy$","$problem$"], separator = "$"
**Output:** ["easy","problem"]
**Explanation:** In this example we split as follows: 

"$easy$" splits into "easy" (excluding empty strings)
"$problem$" splits into "problem" (excluding empty strings)

Hence, the resulting array is ["easy","problem"].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = ["|||"], separator = "|"
**Output:** []
**Explanation:** In this example the resulting split of "|||" will contain only empty strings, so we return an empty array []. 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
- characters in `words[i]` are either lowercase English letters or characters from the string `".,|$#@"` (excluding the quotes)
- `separator` is a character from the string `".,|$#@"` (excluding the quotes)


## First Approach

1. **Initialize an Empty Array:**
    
    - The function starts by initializing an empty array called `Array` (it's advisable to use a different variable name since "Array" is a reserved keyword in JavaScript).
2. **Iterate Over Each Word in the Input Array:**
    
    - The function uses a `for...of` loop to iterate over each string in the `words` array.
3. **Process Each Character in a Word:**
    
    - Within the outer loop, there is another loop that iterates over each character in the current word.
    - If the character is equal to the specified `separator`, the code checks if the `wordString` (a temporary variable to store the current substring) has a length greater than or equal to 1.
    - If true, it means that a valid substring is found, so it is pushed into the `Array`.
    - The `wordString` is then reset to an empty string.
4. **Building the Substring:**
    
    - If the character is not the `separator`, it is appended to the `wordString`.
5. **Final Check and Push:**
    
    - After the inner loop, there is a final check to see if the `wordString` has a length greater than or equal to 1.
    - If true, it means that there is a non-empty substring at the end of the word, so it is pushed into the `Array`.
6. **Return the Resulting Array:**
    
    - The function returns the `Array` containing all the non-empty substrings extracted from the input words.
7. **Note on Edge Cases:**
    
    - The code seems to handle the cases where the separator is the first or last character in a word, resulting in empty strings.

```js
var splitWordsBySeparator = function(words, separator) {

    let Array = [];
    for (const word of words){
        let wordString =''
        for(let i = 0 ; i<word.length ; i++){
            if(word[i] === separator){
                if(wordString.length >= 1){

                    Array.push(wordString)
                }
                wordString = ''
                continue ;
            }
            wordString += word[i]
        }
        if(wordString.length >= 1){
            Array.push(wordString)
        }
    }
    return Array ;

};
```
